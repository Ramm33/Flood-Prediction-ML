# Rising Waters
A Machine Learning Approach to Flood Prediction
# Project Overview

Rising Waters is a data-driven flood prediction system that leverages Machine Learning techniques to forecast potential flood risks using historical rainfall, river water levels, and environmental datasets. The goal of this project is to improve early warning systems, enhance disaster preparedness, and support data-informed decision-making for communities and authorities.

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters worldwide. By analyzing patterns in historical environmental data, this project aims to predict high-risk situations before they occur, enabling timely preventive measures.
